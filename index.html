<h1>Attractions</h1><!-- <p>She sells seashells on a seashore
But the value of these shells will fall
Due to the laws of supply and demand
No one wants to buy shells 'cause there's loads on the sand

<i>Step 1:</i> you must create a sense of scarcity
Shells will sell much better if the people think they're rare, you see
Bare with me, take as many shells as you can find and hide 'em on an island stockpile 'em high 
until they're rarer than a <b>diamond</b>

<i>Step 2:</i> you gotta make the people think that they want 'em
Really want 'em, really <u>freaking</u> want 'em
Hit 'em like Bronson
Influencers, product placement, featured prime time entertainment If you haven't got a shell then you're just a freaking waste man

<i>Three:</i> it's monopoly, invest inside some property, start a corporation, make a logo, do it properly 
"Shells must sell", that will be your new philosophy
Swallow all your morals <b><i>they're a poor man's quality</i></b>

<i>Four:</i> expand, expand, expand, clear forest, make land, fresh blood on hand 
<i>Five:</i> why just shells? Why limit your self? She sells seashells, sell oil as well!

<i>Six:</i> guns, sell stocks, sell diamonds, sell rocks, sell water to a fish, sell the time to a clock 
<i>Seven:</i> press on the gas, take your foot off the brakes, <b><i>Run to be the president of the United States</i></b>

<i>Eight:</i> big smile mate, big wave that's great Now the truth is overrated, tell lies out the gate

<i>Nine:</i> <b>Polarize the people</b>, controversy is the game
It don't matter if they hate you if they all say your name

<i>Ten:</i> the world is yours, step out on a stage to a round of applause You're a liar, a cheat, a devil, a whore
<i>And you sell seashells on the seashore</i></p> -->
